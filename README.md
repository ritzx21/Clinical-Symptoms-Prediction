# Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning #
This Python-based project is designed to predict diseases based on provided symptoms using machine learning techniques.



### Data and Preprocessing ###
There are a total of 4 datasets used.
- Symptom_severity.cvs dataset has the severity score for each symptom.
- dataset.csv has the disease and the corresponding symptoms listed.
- Symptom_description.cvs has a detailed description of each disease
- Symptom_precaution.csv has precautionary measures for every disease

### Machine Learning Model ### 
A Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Multinomial Logistic Regression were used , out of which accuracy using Random Forest Classifier was the highest.
